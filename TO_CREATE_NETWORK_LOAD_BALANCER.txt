TO CREATE AN NETWORK LOAD BALANCER:-
1. First launch 6 instances,each 2 of them form the same modules.
2. From EC2 console select target groups:-
 ---- create 3 different target groups,each of them having 2 insurance of same modules 
3. Now we need to create an APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER :-
1.select load balancer 
2.select application load balancer :-
--- go with default configurations
 --- add the same security groups as applied to instances 
----For Listeners and routing:- 
  ---Keep default listener port :80 and For Default action, choose the target group that you created.
---review and create load balancer 
3.select the created load balancer and select the rule from the panal then 
--Select add rule 
-- add the rule for target groups.and create rule .
4.Now we need to create a TARGET GROUP for APL:-
--- select the target groups and create a target group 
--- select using ALP 
--- then select the create APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER
-- keep default configuration and create target group 
5.NOW let's create a NETWORK LOAD BALANCER:-
   1.select load balancer and select NETWORK LOAD BALANCER 
2.go with Basic configuration :-
       ---- select same security groups 
       --- In Listeners and routing:-  keep default port :80 and   select the 4th target group that we have create USING ALP.
    ---keep option configuration default and create 
6.now Test the load balancer :- 
----choose Load Balancers and Select the Network load  balancer.
---Copy the DNS name of the load balancer
